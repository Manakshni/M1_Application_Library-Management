INTRODUCTION

This project is about a method that traffic police use for measuring the speed of moving objects using Distance,CCTV and IR sensors.Municipalities around the world use it to detect speeders and generate revenue,These are used to detect the speed of moving object,speed checker will come handy for the highway traffic police as it will not only provide a digital display in accordance with a vehicle's speed but sound an alarm if the vehicle exceeds the permissible speed for the high way.There are definite rules laid out by authorities about driving vehicle on roads. The most common rule in any country is speed limit in certain roads i.e. you will be in violation of the law if your vehicle speed exceeds this limit.

In order to detect the speed of a moving vehicle, the patrolling officers usually depend on a handheld gun that works on Radar Technology or Lidar Technology. This is a tedious process as the officer has to manually check for over speeding for each vehicle.

What if the vehicle Speed Detection is made automatic? A simple automatic detection of speed of a vehicle is designed in vehicle Speed Detector project, where you can place the system in one place and view the results instantly without any human intervention.
