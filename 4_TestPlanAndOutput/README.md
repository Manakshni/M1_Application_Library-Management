 # TEST PLAN:

HLT_01- sensing a car and detect over speed limit crossing within a range of sensors and transmit the data to control room.

HLT_02-	sensing a bus and detect over speed limit crossing within a range of sensors and transmit the data to control room.

HLT_03-	sensing a lorry and detect over speed limit crossing within a range of sensors and transmit the data to control room.

HLT_04-	sensing a van and detect over speed limit crossing within a range of sensors and transmit the data to control room.
