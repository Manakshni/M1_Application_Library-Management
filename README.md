# Challenges Faced and How it Overcome

Vehicle tracking is the process of locating a moving vehicle using a camera.

Capture vehicle in video sequence from surveillance camera is demanding application to improve tracking performance. 

This technology is increasing the number of applications such as traffic control,traffic monitoring, traffic flow, security etc.

The estimated cost using this technology will be very less. 

Video and image processing has been used for traffic surveillance, analysis and monitoring of traffic conditions in many cities and urban areas. 

Various methods for speed estimation are proposed in recent years.

All approaches attempt to increase accuracy and decrease cost of hardware implementation. 

The aim is to build an automatic system that can accurately localise and track the speed of any vehicles that appear in aerial video frames.
